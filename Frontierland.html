<h3>Mark Twain Riverboat</h3>
<p>Board an old-fashioned steam-powered vessel for a half-mile journey into the heart of the American frontier. 
During the charming, 14-minute trip around Pirate’s Lair on Tom Sawyer Island, spot delightful sights along the river’s edge, including: 
The north bank of the Columbia Gorge, complete with a beautiful waterfront and 5 sparkling waterfalls, 
A rustic frontier cabin, 
An idyllic Native American village, 
A busy beaver at work chewing on the train trestle, 
Mountain lions relaxing in the sun, 
The Disneyland Railroad steaming into the wilderness,
Along the way, hear lively narration about a time gone by.
Walt Disney named the Mark Twain after the pen name of Samuel Langhorne Clemens. The famed author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn—and Walt’s personal hero—Clemens was also a riverboat pilot as a young man.</p>
